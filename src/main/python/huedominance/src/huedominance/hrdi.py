	"""
	Hue Range Dominance Index (HRDI) algorithm
	
	Computes "dominance index" for a range of hues in an image, taking hue saturation into
	account. The index value ranges between 0 and 1, and gives a natural measure of "how much of a certain color" there is in an image.
	The theoretical maximum of 1 corresponds to all of the pixels having hues withing the specified range, and all the hues being fully saturated.
	The theoretical minimum of 0 corresponds to all pixels either having a hue outside the specified range, or having zero saturation (i.e. being white).

	The algorithm has the following steps:
	 - convert the image to HSV (hue-saturation-value) color model
	 - compute the total sum of the V channel values for the whole image (v_total)
	 - set V of pixels outside the hue range to zero
	 - multiply V channel with S channel, normalized to [0,1] range instead of [0, 255]
	 - compute the total sum of thus obtained V channel (v_hue_range_adjusted)
	 - the ratio v_hue_range_adjusted / v_total gives the HRDI value for the image
	The function optionally produces an illustration: a "masked" image of the pixels within the chosen hue range, with their V set
	to pixel's contribution to the index, H is preserved, and S set to max for illustrative purposes. The illustration shows how
	the index "sees" the original image.

	Parameters
	----------
	image: Image.Image
		an image object as obtained using Pillow (PIL fork) library
	hue_min_deg: int
		minimal hue value (angle) in degrees. Zero corresponds to red, 120 to green, 240 or -120 to blue
	hue_max_deg: int
		maximal hue value, save data type as for hue_min_deg
	make_illustration: bool, optional
		a flag specifying whether the illustration image needs to be produced

	Returns
	-------
	tuple[float, Image.Image]
		a tuple of HRDI value and the illustration image. If make_illustration is False, the second element in the tuple is None.
