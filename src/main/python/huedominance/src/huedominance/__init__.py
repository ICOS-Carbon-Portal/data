"""Hue Range Dominance Index (HRDI) algorithm

HRDI gives a natural measure of "how much of a certain color" (or color range) an image contains.
The package contains functions hrdi and gcc, the latter can be used for comparison of HRDI with a
popular Green Cromatic Coordinate (GCC) measure used as a vegetation index for plant phenology image analysis.
Please refer to the hrdi function documentation for specifics of the algorithm.
