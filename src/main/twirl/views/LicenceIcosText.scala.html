						<p>ICOS Research Infrastructure will provide high quality, long-term observations using standardized observations across the whole network. ICOS data meets, and sometimes exceeds or even sets the global standards for atmospheric, ecosystem flux and marine observations of greenhouse gases. &nbsp;All information on observations and the metadata is stored in persistent trusted long-term repositories for current and future use of the data. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Identification of data throughout its lifecycle is essential. This can be achieved by allocating unique and persistent digital identifiers (PIDs or DOIs) to data objects.</p>

						<p>The PIDs allow to make unambiguous references to data during curation, cataloguing and support provenance tracking. They are also needed for correct citation (and hence attribution) of the data by end users.</p>

						<p>In short, in today’s expanding “open data world”, PIDs are an essential tool for establishing clear links between all entities involved in or connected with any given research project</p>
