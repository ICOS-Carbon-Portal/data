					</button>
				</h2>
				<div class="accordion-collapse collapse">
					<div class="accordion-body">
						ICOS Research Infrastructure will provide high quality, long-term observations using

						or even sets, the global standards for atmospheric, ecosystem flux and marine observations
						of greenhouse gases. All information on observations and the metadata is stored in
						persistent trusted long-term repositories for current and future use of the data.

						About PIDs
					</button>
				</h2>
				<div class="accordion-collapse collapse">
					<div class="accordion-body">
						<p>
							Identification of data throughout its lifecycle is essential. This can be achieved by
							allocating unique and persistent digital identifiers (PIDs or DOIs) to data objects.
						</p>

						<p>
							The PIDs allow one to make unambiguous references to data during curation, cataloguing
							and support provenance tracking. They are also needed for correct citation (and hence
							attribution) of the data by end users.
						</p>

						<p>
							In short, in today's expanding "open data world", PIDs are an essential tool for
							establishing clear links between all entities involved in or connected with any given
							research project.
