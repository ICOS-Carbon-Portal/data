				<div class="panel-collapse collapse in" aria-expanded="true" style="">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Identification of data throughout its lifecycle is essential. This can be achieved by
							allocating unique and persistent digital identifiers (PIDs or DOIs) to data objects.</p>

						<p>The PIDs allow to make unambiguous references to data during curation, cataloguing and
							support provenance tracking. They are also needed for correct citation (and hence
							attribution) of the data by end users.</p>

						<p>In short, in today’s expanding “open data world”, PIDs are an essential tool for establishing
							clear links between all entities involved in or connected with any given research project
