				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Data from the SITES Data Portal must be properly cited and acknowledged.</p>

					<h5><b>Citation</b></h5>
					<p>Citation of a dataset is handled similar to that of a publication. On the metadata page of the dataset a citation is provided. </p>
					<p>Example:
					Svartberget Field Research Station. 2019. Meteorological from Degerö, 2000-12-31 – 2014-12-31. SITES Data Portal. https://hdl.handle.net/11676.1/8uNF3qqyXBclYG7mBFj9Adn4</p>
					<p>The persistent identifier (DOI or PID) will always lead you back to the metadata page where be able to download the data object again or check for updates.</p>
					<p>You may also use or link to pictures and use visualisations obtained from SITES Data Portal if you add the link to the original and the text "SITES, licensed under CCBY" followed by the link to the original source.</p>

					<h5><b>Acknowledgement</b></h5>
					<p>We urge you to contact and inform the data providers when the data is used for publications and to offer them the possibility
						to comment and/or offer them co-authorship or acknowledgement in the publication when this is justified by the added value of the data for your results.</p>
					<p>Any publication using SITES data must include the following statement in the acknowledgement:
					 ”This [study/report/dataset/etc.] has been made possible by data provided by the Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science (SITES).”</p>

			</div>
			<div class="panel-collapse collapse in" aria-expanded="true" style="">
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Identification of data throughout its lifecycle is essential. This can be achieved by allocating unique
						and persistent digital identifiers (DOI or PID) to data objects. The link provided will always resolve to its landing page (metadata page).</p>
					<p>The PIDs allow to make unambiguous references to data during curation, cataloguing and support provenance tracking.
						They are also needed for correct citation (and hence attribution) of the data by end users.</p>
					<p>In short, in today’s expanding world of open data, PIDs are essential tools for establishing clear links
						between all entities involved in or connected with any given project.</p>
